### Architecture

3D residual convolution blocks separated by ReLU nonlinearites.
The spatial resolution between the input and output of the 
network are identical.

This architecture is nearly identical to the PixelCNN [[pixelcnn]], the
first convolutional network used in connectomic reconstruction.
